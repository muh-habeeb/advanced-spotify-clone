## Usage in Documentation

Once screenshots are added, reference them in the main README.md like this:

```markdown
![Homepage](docs/screenshots/homepage.png)
*Main dashboard showing featured music and navigation*
```

Or create a gallery:

```markdown
<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/homepage.png" alt="Homepage" width="400"/>
  <img src="docs/screenshots/player.png" alt="Music Player" width="400"/>
</div>
```
